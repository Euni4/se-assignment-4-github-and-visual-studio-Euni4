# Open a Pull Request:

Navigate to the repository and click "Pull requests" > "New pull request."
Select the base branch and compare branch.
Provide a title and description, then create the PR.
Reviewing a Pull Request

# View the PR:

Go to the "Pull requests" tab and select the PR.

# Review Changes:

Examine the code changes in the "Files changed" tab.

# Comment and Discuss:

Add comments and discuss with team members.

# Approve or Request Changes:

Approve if satisfactory or request further changes.

# Merge the PR:

Click "Merge pull request" and confirm.

# Delete Branch (Optional):

Delete the feature branch to keep the repository clean.

6. GitHub Actions:
Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

# Here's how it works:

Workflows: You define workflows as YAML files in your repository. These workflows specify a sequence of steps that should be executed when a certain event occurs, like a code push or a pull request.
Jobs and Steps: Each workflow consists of one or more jobs. A job groups related steps together, which can run sequentially or in parallel. Steps are specific actions within your workflow, such as building code, running tests, or deploying to a server.

# Benefits of Automating Workflows:

Reduced Manual Work: Repetitive tasks are automated, freeing developers for more creative work.
Improved Consistency: Ensures all code goes through the same process, reducing errors.
Faster Feedback: Automates testing and deployment, allowing for quicker feedback on changes.
Simple CI/CD Pipeline Example:
Here's a basic example of a CI/CD pipeline built with GitHub Actions:

Workflow Trigger: This workflow runs whenever there's a push to the master branch.

# Jobs:

Build Job:
Steps:
Check out the code from the repository.
Install dependencies (e.g., using Node.js npm install).
Build the code (e.g., using a build script).
Test Job:

# Steps:
Run unit tests for the application.
Workflow Output:

The workflow will fail if any step fails, notifying developers of potential issues.
Once successful, the code is considered ready for deployment (potentially to another workflow).
